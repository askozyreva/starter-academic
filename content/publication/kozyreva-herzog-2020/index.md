abstract: "Despite their ubiquity online, personalization algorithms and the associated\
  \  large-scale collection of personal data have largely escaped public scrutiny.\
  \ Yet policy makers who wish to introduce regulations that respect people's attitudes\
  \ towards privacy and algorithmic personalization on the Internet would greatly\
  \ benefit from knowing how people perceive different aspects of personalization\
  \ and data collection. To contribute to an empirical foundation for this knowledge,\
  \ we surveyed public attitudes using representative online samples in Germany, Great\
  \ Britain, and the United States on key aspects of algorithmic personalization and\
  \ on people's data privacy concerns and behavior. Our findings show that people\
  \ object to the collection and use of sensitive personal information and to the\
  \ personalization of political campaigning and, in Germany and Great Britain, to\
  \ the personalization of news sources. Encouragingly, attitudes are independent\
  \ of political preferences: People across the political spectrum share the same\
  \ concerns about their data privacy and the effects of personalization on news and\
  \ politics. We also found that people are more accepting of personalized services\
  \ than of the collection of personal data and information currently collected for\
  \ these services. This acceptability gap---the difference between the acceptability\
  \ of personalized online services and the acceptability of the collection and use\
  \ of data and information---in people's attitudes can be observed at both the aggregate\
  \ and the individual level. Our findings suggest a need for transparent algorithmic\
  \ personalization that respects peopleâ€™s data privacy, can be easily adjusted, and\
  \ does not extend to political advertising."
