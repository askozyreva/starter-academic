abstract: 'Drawing from many disciplines, the report adopts a behavioural psychology
  perspective to argue that “social media changes people’s political behaviour”. Four
  pressure points are identified and analysed in detail: the attention economy; choice
  architectures; algorithmic content curation; and mis/disinformation. Policy implications
  are outlined in detail.'
