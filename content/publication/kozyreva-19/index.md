abstract: Despite the ubiquity of uncertainty, scientific attention has focused primarily
  on probabilistic approaches, which predominantly rely on the assumption that uncertainty
  can be measured and expressed numerically. At the same time, the increasing amount
  of research from a range of areas including psychology, economics, and sociology
  testify that in the real world, people’s understanding of risky and uncertain situations
  cannot be satisfactorily explained in probabilistic and decision-theoretical terms.
  In this article, we offer a theoretical overview of an alternative approach to uncertainty
  developed in the framework of the ecological rationality research program. We first
  trace the origins of the ecological approach to uncertainty in Simon’s bounded rationality
  and Brunswik’s lens model framework and then proceed by outlining a theoretical
  view of uncertainty that ensues from the ecological rationality approach. We argue
  that the ecological concept of uncertainty relies on a systemic view of uncertainty
  that features it as a property of the organism–environment system. We also show
  how simple heuristics can deal with unmeasurable uncertainty and in what cases ignoring
  probabilities emerges as a proper response to uncertainty.
